# Slim Framework for PHP 5

Thank you for choosing Slim, a micro-framework for PHP 5 inspired by [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com).

## Features

Slim provides the following notable features out-of-the-box:

* Clean and simple DSL for writing powerful web applications
* RESTful routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * Named routes w/ `urlFor()` helper
  * Route passing
  * Route redirects
  * Route halting
  * Custom **Not Found** handler
  * Custom **Error** handler
  * Optional route segments... /archive(/:year(/:month(/:day)))
* Easy app configuration
* Easy templating with custom Views (ie. Twig, Smarty, Mustache, ...)
* Cookie handling with optional AES-256 encryption
* HTTP caching (ETag and Last-Modified)
* Logging
* Error handling
* Supports PHP 5+

## "Hello World" application (PHP 5 >= 5.3)

The Slim Framework supports anonymous routes. This is the preferred method of defining Slim application routes.

    <?php
    require 'slim/Slim.php';
    Slim::init();
    Slim::get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    });
    Slim::run();
    ?>

## "Hello World" application (PHP 5 < 5.3)

If you are running PHP 5 < 5.3, the second `Slim::get` parameter will be the name of a callable function instead of an anonymous function.

    <?php
    require 'slim/Slim.php';
    Slim::init();
    Slim::get('/hello/:name', 'hello');
    function hello($name) {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    }
    Slim::run();
    ?>

## Get Started

### Install Slim

Download the Slim Framework and unzip the downloaded file into your virtual host's public directory. Slim will work in a sub-directory, too.

### Setup .htaccess

Ensure the `.htaccess` and `bootstrap.php` files are in the same public-accessible directory. The `.htaccess` file should contain this code:

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ bootstrap.php [QSA,L]

### Build Your Application

Your Slim application will be defined in `bootstrap.php`. First, `require` the Slim Framework:

	require 'slim/Slim.php';

Next, initialize the Slim application:

	Slim::init();

Next, define your application's routes:

	Slim::get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
		echo "Hello $name";
	});

Finally, run your Slim application:

	Slim::run();

For more information about building an application with the Slim Framework, refer to the [official documentation](http://github.com/codeguy/Slim/wiki/Slim-Framework-Documentation).
