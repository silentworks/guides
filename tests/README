Slim Tests

This directory contains unit tests for each Slim class. I am using PHPUnit
to test the Slim class files.

1. Install PHPUnit
To learn more about PHPUnit, visit http://www.phpunit.de/

2. Run tests
From the slim/tests/ directory, run `phpunit AllTests`. This command will
run all available unit tests and display the test results.
